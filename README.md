*DESCRIPTION: 

Text Generation with LSTM and GPT-2
This project demonstrates two different approaches to text generation:

LSTM Model: A character-level text generator built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras

GPT-2 Model: Leveraging Hugging Face's pre-trained transformer model for advanced text generation

Features
LSTM Implementation:

Custom-trained on AI/ML domain text

Character-level prediction with embedding layer

Two-layer LSTM architecture

GPT-2 Implementation:

Pre-trained model fine-tuning

Configurable generation parameters (temperature, top-k sampling)

Human-like text generation

Technical Stack
Python 3.8+

TensorFlow 2.x

PyTorch (for GPT-2)

Hugging Face Transformers

Numpy

Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-generation-comparison.git
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook Text_Generation_Notebook.ipynb
Sample Outputs
LSTM Generation:

"Artificial intelligence is transforming industries across the world machine learning algorithms can now recognize patterns"
GPT-2 Generation:

"Machine learning is revolutionizing how we process information, enabling systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed."
